abstract: "Detail-and-geometry richness is essential to bas-relief modelling. However, existing image-based and model-based bas-relief modelling techniques commonly suffer from detail monotony or geometry loss. In this paper, we introduce a new bas-relief modelling framework for detail abundance with visual attention based mask generation and geometry preservation, which benefits from our two key contributions. For detail richness, we propose a novel semantic neural network of normal transfer to enrich the texture styles on bas-reliefs. For geometry preservation, we introduce a normal decomposition scheme based on Domain Transfer Recursive Filter (DTRF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is advantageous on producing bas-relief modellings with both fine details and geometry preservation."
