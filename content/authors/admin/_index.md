I am currently a Research Fellow in Zhejiang University China, especially working on Image editing and Multimodal Alginment across modalities (e.g., audios, images and texts). I am also an experienced Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer with 9+ years experience (including 3+ years commercial experience). I have managed and completed 7+ projects, which applies cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models to solve real-world and research cases. I have extensive experience of designing and building up machine learning frameworks independently and training large datasets on the GPU Cloud. I'm experienced on software/system development and image/video/geometry processing. I obtained my PhD degree on Computer Vision and Deep Learning at National Centre for Computer Animation, Bournemouth University, Top1 animation centre in UK, 2020. I received my M.Eng. and B.Sci. degrees in Computer Science at Jilin University in 2016 and 2013, respectively.

I like to get my hands dirty on programming and try new things on up-to-date applications. I love sharing ideas with people and learning from them as well. I post many things on this website, and hope you'll find something interesting.
