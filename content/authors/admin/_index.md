I am currently a PhD candidate of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics at National Centre for Computer Animation, Bournemouth University, UK. My research focuses on image/video based neural style transfer, in particular, photo style transfer, coherent video style transfer and geometry texture synthesis using deep learning techniques. I received my M.Eng and B.Sci degrees from Department of Computer Science at Jilin University in 2016 and 2013, respectively. Then I got a 4-year PhD scholarship from Bournemouth University and China Scholarship Council.
