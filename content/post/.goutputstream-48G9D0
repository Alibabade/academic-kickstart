## Deep Correlations for Texture Synthesis (TOG2017)
### Motivation
The texture synthesis using [deep feature maps](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5633-texture-synthesis-using-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) has difficulty to synthesize structure textures, which is a challenge to preserve the non-local structures. 
### Core Ideas
1. Introduce a structure matrix to represent the deep correlation among deep features. In another word, [Gatys et al.,2015](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5633-texture-synthesis-using-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) consider the Gram loss of deep features between channels, while acutally the structure information is included inside each feature channel. Thus  [Sendik et al., 2017](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/b1fe6d_f4f1684f6ba647ffbf1148c3721fdfc4.pdf) propose an intra-feature based Gram loss, which is fomulated as: 

$$ R^{l,n}_{i,j} = \sum_{q,m} w_{i,j} f^{l,n}_{q,m} f^{l,n}_{q-i,m-j} $$
